## Main notebook for training, testing, & screening 

- metal_hydride_ML_v* / continually updated Jupyter notebooks to utilize models trained as more data is available, better featurization is derived, etc.


## Additional Resources

- ml_data / Contains incremental versions of the final ML-HydPARK database and 

- experiments / Contains incremental versions of relevant new experimental data taken from the literature

- models / Stores version controlled models for metal hydride thermodynamics (as well as a compositional bulk modulus model, and an HEA phase prediction model) 

- figures / to store results from various model versions
